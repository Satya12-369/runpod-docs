We support two types of streaming generator functions:\nregular generator and async generator.\nReturn aggregate Stream\nBy default, when a generator handler is running, the fractional outputs will only be available at the /stream\nendpoint, if you would also like the outputs to be available from the /run  and /runsync  endpoints you will\nneed to set return_aggregate_stream  to True when starting your handler.\nEdit this page\nimport runpod\ndef generator_handler(job):\n    for count in range(3):\n        result = f\"This is the {count} generated output.\"\n        yield result\nrunpod.serverless.start(\n    {\n        \"handler\": generator_handler,  # Required\n        \"return_aggregate_stream\": True,  # Optional, results available via /run\n    }\n)\nConvert web pages and HTML files to PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API\nPrinted with Pdfcrowd.com\n"
