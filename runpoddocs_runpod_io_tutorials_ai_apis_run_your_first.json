It is useful for\ntesting your model and debugging. Recommended for jobs that take less than 15 seconds.\nFor example, if you are using the Stable Diffusion v1 inference endpoint, you would make a\nrequest like the following:\nInput\nOutput\nexport YOUR_API_KEY=<KEY>\ncurl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/stable-diffusion-v1/runsync \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\nAsk AI\nAsk AI\nRunPod\nYou would get an immediate response that includes a unique job ID. You can then query the\nstatus endpoint and pass it your job ID. The status endpoint will give you the job results when\ncompleted.\nRun\nRun is an asynchronous endpoint that runs your model and returns a job ID. It is useful for\nrunning your model in the background. Recommended for jobs that take more than 15 seconds.\nFor example, if you are using the Stable Diffusion v1 inference endpoint, you would make a\nrequest like the following:\nInput\nOutput\nStatus\nStatus is an endpoint that returns the status of your job.\nFor checking the status of your job, you would make a request like the following:\nInput\nOutput\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}\" \\\n    -d '{\"input\": {\"prompt\": \"a cute magical flying dog, fantasy art drawn\ncurl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/stable-diffusion-v1/run \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}\" \\\n    -d '{\"input\": {\"prompt\": \"a cute magical flying dog, fantasy art drawn\ncurl https://api.runpod.ai/v2/stable-diffusion-v1/status/1b30c19b-9729-46d\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}\"\nAsk AI\nAsk AI\nCancel\nCancel is an endpoint that cancels your job. It is useful for cancelling your job.\nInput\nOutput\nHealth\nHealth is an endpoint that returns the health of your serverless worker. It is useful for checking\nthe health of your serverless worker. The health check is a utility function that can be called on\nany endpoint to provide worker and queue metrics.\nInput\nOutput\nNOTE\nYou must retrieve your results via the status endpoint within 30 minutes as RunPod does\nnot keep your inputs or outputs longer than that to protect your privacy.\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n\u00ab Generate images with SDXL Turbo\nNext\nBanana \u00bb\ncurl https://api.runpod.ai/v2/stable-diffusion-v1/cancel/1b30c19b-9729-46d\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}\"\ncurl --request GET \\\n     --url https://api.runpod.ai/v2/stable-diffusion-v1/health \\\n     --header \"accept: application/json\" \\\n     --header \"authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}\"\nAsk AI\nAsk AI\nDocs\nOverview\nTutorials\nAI APIs\nCommunity\nDiscord\nContact us\nMore\nBlog\nGitHub\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 RunPod\nAsk AI\nAsk AI\n"
