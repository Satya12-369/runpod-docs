Each state provides insight into the job's\ncurrent status and helps in managing the job \ufb02ow effectively.\nJob state\nHere are the states a job can be in:\nIN_QUEUE : This state indicates that the job is currently in the endpoint queue. It's waiting\nfor an available worker to pick it up for processing.\nIN_PROGRESS : Once a worker picks up the job, its state changes to IN_PROGRESS . This\nmeans the job is actively being processed and is no longer in the queue.\nCOMPLETED : After the job successfully \ufb01nishes processing and returns a result, it moves to\nthe COMPLETED  state. This indicates the successful execution of the job.\nFAILED : If a job encounters an error during its execution and returns with an error, it is\nmarked as FAILED . This state signi\ufb01es that the job did not complete successfully and\nencountered issues.\nCANCELLED : Jobs can be manually cancelled using the /cancel/job_id  endpoint. If a\njob is cancelled before it completes or fails, it will be in the CANCELLED  state.\nTIMED_OUT : This state occurs in two scenarios: when a job expires before a worker picks it\nup, or if the worker fails to report back a result for the job before it reaches its timeout\nthreshold.\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n\u00ab Endpoint operations\nNext\nAI APIs \u00bb\nAsk AI\nAsk AI\nRunPod\nDocs\nOverview\nTutorials\nAI APIs\nCommunity\nDiscord\nContact us\nMore\nBlog\nGitHub\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 RunPod\nAsk AI\nAsk AI\n"
